                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a 90's kid who's always been fascinated by the blend of technology and business. As a Product Manager, I have a lot of experience leading teams to create great products. I love figuring out what customers want, shaping product plans, and using market knowledge to make things better for users and businesses. With my strong background in product management and focus on customer satisfaction, I enjoy tackling tough problems and making them into successes.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>My career path has been a bit different, but I've loved every step of it. Before diving into the tech world, I worked in customer success, helping customers find solutions and learn about products. Now, I'm focused on creating solutions that directly solve customer problems and help businesses succeed.</p>

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p>I'm a big sports fan, and lately, I've discovered a passion for reading books, thanks to some great advice from my manager/mentor. It's really transformed how I approach my role as a product manager. Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with both my family and my furry friends.</p>

In this capacity, I not only identify the right problems to solve but also collaborate closely with the founder/CTO to ensure our solutions align with our company's vision. Sharing these insights with the development team and working hand-in-hand with cross-functional teams, I ensure that our output adds significant value and contributes to achieving our desired outcomes. Regularly checking in with customers, I strive to ensure that our products effectively address their needs and pain points.</p>
